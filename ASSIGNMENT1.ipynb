        "1) What is Python, and why is it popular ?\n",
        "  \n",
        "    -> Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and versatility. It is widely popular because of the following reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "    i)It is widely used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.\n",
        "    ii)Python is designed to be easy to understand and write, making it a great choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike.\n",
        "    iii)Python is open-source and has a large community that contributes to its extensive libraries and frameworks and many more\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2)What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -> An interpreter in python is a program that converts/interprets high level language written by human into machine level language line by line (i.e. converts one line at a time). programs written in this are easy to debug,more flexible,and provides efficient memory allocation but it is slower than a compiler.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3) What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "   \n",
        "    -> Pre-defined keywords in python are words that are previously defined in python and each of them have a special meaning and have a specific purpose. There are many keywords in python which we can se if we rum the following code:\n",
        "        help(\"keywords\")\n",
        "   eg- def( used to define a function), if/else(for conditional statements) etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  4)Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -> NO, keywords cannont be used as variable names as when we compile a code where we have used a keyword as a variable name it will give us an error\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  5) What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    ->Mutability in python refers to the process of changing the value of an object after its creations.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  6)  Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -> Tuples are immutable, meaning that once a tuple has been created, you can't replace any of its elements with a new value. Lists are mutable, meaning that you can always change a list's elements. Only immutable elements can be used as dictionary keys, and hence only tuples and not lists can be used as keys\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  7) What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -> In Python \"==\" is used to check whether the values of two variables in a code is equal/same or not where \"is\" is used to check whether two variables points to the same memory location or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  8) What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    ->  Lopgical Operators in python is used to combine conditional statements.There are three logical operators:\n",
        "    i) AND - gives true if both the conditions are true\n",
        "    ii) OR - gives true if anyone of the condition is true\n",
        "    iii) NOT- reverses the condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  9) What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -> Type casting in python is the process of changing the data types of a value or an object. For eg: we can change a=2 which is an INTEGER to a STRING bny executing this line: str(a)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  10) What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "\n",
        "    ->  There are two types of type casting:\n",
        "    i) Implicit - here python understands standard data type automatically.for eg: if we write a=2 python will automatically understand tha its an integer\n",
        "    ii) Explicit -  here we have to change the data type as the original data type doesn't matches with what python thinks it is, For eg: if we write a =\"2\" python will think it as an string while its an integer so we have to convert it to an integer.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  11) What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "    -> The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to control the flow of execution in a program based on whether certain conditions are true or false. They enable a program to make decisions and perform different actions depending on various scenarios, inputs, or data states.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  12) How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -> In python the elif is used when there are multiple conditions it allows to code to check all the conditions one by one and select the one which meets the criteria.Syntax-\n",
        "          if condition1:\n",
        "              do this\n",
        "          elif condition2:\n",
        "              do this\n",
        "          elif condition3:\n",
        "              do this\n",
        "          else:\n",
        "              do this\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  13) What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -> The main difference between while and for loop in python is that:\n",
        "    i) while loop is used when you want to iterate a task until a specific condition is met, on the other hand\n",
        "    ii) for loop is used when you know how amny times we habe to iterate a task or when we have to iterate a task within a specific range\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  14)  Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n",
        "\n",
        "    ->  WHILE loop is used when you want to iterate a task until a specific condition is met, on the other hand. For example, reading data from a file until a specific marker is found, or prompting a user for input until valid input is received. In such cases, the loop continues as long as the condition is true, making a while loop a natural fit\n",
